One of the other uses for Ancestry & Culture is for my homebrewed Sachima. Descended from an ancient dragon and a celestial tiger, members of the culture choose a path that explores one of the aspects of their ancestry. Each aspect has different class options and touchstones.

The Dragon path centers on breath, strength, & discipline. The arcane focus is exhaling. The polymorph self spell is powerful and mesmerizing to see. The martial focus is a pair of swords evoking dragon's jaws. The mental focus involves long-range planning akin to chess.

The tiger path centers on stretching, quickness, and curiosity. Magic is centered around research distinctive for its compare, contrast, connect methodology that is almost lyrical. Martial foci include leaping and the use of steelcloth kept taut through snatches amd twirls.

The third path embraces them both. Members of Sachima culture on this path are as revered as they are rare. True polymaths, they are more than a balance, but a fusion of the two paths. In an a culture that values contests, they excel in many kinds instead of a focused few.

PS: With Ancestry & Culture, I feel like I have a seamless way of creating the Sachima player option instead of my bolt-on rule system. I can also integrate the people of diff ancestries into the culture as originally imagined 6 years ago when I first wrote about them. 

Side Note: The origin of the Sachima is loosely based on the story of my wife and I. I have grown so much as a person through her.
