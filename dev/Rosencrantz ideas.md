## Arcane Magic Traditions

Magic is everywhere, but Arcane magic is organized locally, or at best, regionally. The chart-based spellcasters have a connection with Porta Nile (usually) or Pella's Column (rarely). The Salt Mages are strongly connected to Camalanth (over 99% of them) or Pella's Column (less than 1%). Penfro (in Camalanth) features the Cult of Hot Iron, a magical tradition that features walls, containers, and the use of goblin spitters. Summoners are based in Gaerleon (because of the gate magic). Hewcasters are based in Vinakrah. Broadhead has no Arcane Magic tradition because of the dominance of the temples there, but Damarell is believed to have a speed or horse or centaur based magic (unknown). Nagelor has dragon magic.

### Scrolls and Potions

Each Arcane Tradition has a different way of handling what D&D traditionally calls *scrolls*. Each traditions' scrolls are mutually unintelligible to the other without the use of *Read Magic*. Even with *Read Magic*, no wizard can transcribe the scroll of one tradition into their own tradition. 

Potions, however, are universal to all Arcane traditions. (It is believed that the rogue's ability to cross arcane traditions comes from this fact.)

## Divine Magic Tradition

Divine Magic is very heavily established throughout the region. The temples to the four totems are everywhere. Every city or town has a Tetratheon (to each of the four totems), after that are smaller shrine to the myriad gods or titans. In larger towns and cities, there is sometimes a shrine to the XO. The XO have never revealed to anyone their true name (Kwemara) or relationship to the gods (spared them) and titans (slaughtered them in revenge for killing Samoora).

Inside the Tetratheon is a room dedicated to the memory of Samoora, the slain father of all divine beings.

Clerics have different powers depending on their patron god, titan, or XO. In other words, not all Clerics can Turn Undead (although every Cleric can cast it as a spell). The XO is a patron to very very few Clerics. Those that are keep it secret and publicly swear their allegiance to a god, but never a titan. The XO encourages the ruse of having a patron god and keeping the patronage of the XO a secret.

### Scrolls and Potions

Divine Magic is very organized and universal throughout the Samoora region, except for Vinakrah. In Vinakrah, there is an alternate form that reveres an ancient dragon instead of the Samoora pantheon. However, a scroll written by any Cleric, including Vinakrah, is understandable and repeatable to any other Cleric.

Almost anyone can read a Cleric scroll, however, there are lethal and generational consequences for those that anger the gods by doing so. The lone exception is the ancient dragon cult in Vinakrah. They are always looking for new followers. (Need to write rules for changing classes if a non-Cleric attempts to cast a cult of dragon Vinakrah spell.)

## Random Things

The ancient dragon at the heart of Sachima culture is the same dragon that is revered by Vinakrah cultists. Something has changed him, likely the death/disappearance of the Mystical Tiger, his wife.
