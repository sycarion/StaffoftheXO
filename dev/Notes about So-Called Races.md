## Notes about So-Called Races

This is an old note, needs to be adapted for Ancestries & Cultures

Day off from work, so 2.5 hours to write. Should've worked on my supers game, but worked on Ommtala instead. 5e descibes non-humans well, so I used the 3 adjectives template to write out two of the odder nom-humans, the Bahidi and the Purvaga.

The Bahidi are tight-knit, outsiders, and yearning.
The Bahidi hide a truth only they know: they are shapeshifters pretending to be human. They have gone to great lengths to make thier villages non-descript. They believe that they came from another world and want to return 1 day.

The Purvaga are harder to fit into 3 words. They arrive as adults with no memories. Most meet other Purvaga waiting for them and asked, "what do you remember?". They are then integrated into their society.

Purvaga run into trouble as they often appear in larger cities and towns. Local officials want to know who they are and where they are from, questions for which the Purvaga have no answers.
Fortunately, older ones have developed a system to claim their 'cousins'.

Many times, Purvaga sneak out after living underground in a city for quite a while. They go to a new town for a while (now they have a name and place of origin). They return to the original town with the same name and a different town of origin.

There are no young Purvaga, only adults and elderly. The older help the younger survive and all honor the First Arrival.
The Three Adjectives? Disciplined, resourceful, respectful of elders.
What makes them special? They can see in brightness and very resistant to fire.

Note: Since this appeared as a Twitter thread, I have all four traditional elements represented as Purvaga. The notes for Genasi are used for them.

Finally, the Sachima. They are militant, egalitarian, and honorable. They are descendants of an ancient dragon and a celestial tiger.
Although Sachima live throughout the region, most live ina southern kingdom where they are a majority of the population.

Their soceity may seem rigid, but it is peaceful and prosperous. Truth is, everyone has rights, but those that wish to rule, whether as emporer, mayor, or potter's guild leader must earn their place by rite of trial. The higher the office, the more serious the trial.

Culturally, Sachima choose a life path based on their dragon or tiger heritage. Both are equally favorable and there is no prejudice between them. Dragon heritage values magic and displays of strength. Tiger heritage values cleverness and physical agility.
