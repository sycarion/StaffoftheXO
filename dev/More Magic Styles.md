## More Magic Styles

One region has a roll 2d6 against a rune based on 'found' alien technology. 

Another uses the 'five salts', each salt is like a school of magic. Salts use usage dice to control supplies of the salts. Refining salt increases the die by 1 or 2. There is a magic item (the Exacter) that allows the die to go up 3 places to a max of d12, but only for one type of salt.

A third uses a device to steal a bit of essence from a creature to make potions and spell-like effects. 

A fourth is dragon magic.

A fifth is gematria using the language of the Pythagoreans	

One of the traditions of magic is a truename system. It turns out that the name for any type of creature is the same. The hard part is finding the 2 numbers associated with an individual. A full true name is "dragon 1623 out of 3005"

Yes, this means a truename mage could find the last one of a type of creature.
I have an adventure sketch called the Penultimate Dragon where the PCs find the next to the last dragon that will ever live.
