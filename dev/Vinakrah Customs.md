## Vinakrah Customs

In Vinakrah, where many fear the ancient **dragon** king and his shapeshifting spies, everyone provides a drop of blood on the doorway. It is believed that the shapeshifters have green or blue blood. The host provides a roaring fire (fuel is rationed) and all bring food and drink.
