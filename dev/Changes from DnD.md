Working on Project Psuedo Semiundecinomia for the kids. Yes, it is horrible Dog Latin. These are my houserules regarding alignment, ancestry, character classes, cosmology, creatures, culture, deities, elementals,  firearms, magic, and psionics.

Details thread starts here: Ancestry and Culture uses options inspired by Arcanist Press. I add in Birthplace as well because that affects Backgrounds.  There is also a quick way to determine this for those that want to just start playing.

Alignment is gone along with spells, feats, and powers based on them. The detection spells will be replaced with detecting creature or energy type. There is also a Fealty spell to detect the level of connection to 11 of the 12 major deities in the setting. (Think icons) 

Major cosmology shifts include: Dimensions and Demiplanes instead of Elemental Planes or Outer Planes. Instead of elementals, there are Quintessentials that embody the dimension or demiplane they are from. Deities stay in the region, rarely visiting their demiplane. 

Another note on Dimension Lore: The 'numerical' ones exist as well and inform spells that involve time travel, probability, and some summoning spells. Again this is lore available to those that want it, but is not needed to play. (My kids are not interested in this lore.) 

Side note: Genasi-like ancestries and cultures exist, but they are much more varied - it is tied to quintessentials. Some are melded with the quintessential force of a demiplane. Most are born of two melded. There are Air and Fire Genasi, but also Evoker or Luck Genasi. 

There are three types of deities: Gods, Titans, and Kwemara. The Creator God that spawned them was killed by a war between the Gods and Titans. The Kwemara ended that war decisively. They supervise the others to prevent another war. The eXo represents them in the setting.

Although there are many Gods and Titans, worship is limited to 7 Gods and 4 Titans, the Hendenciad. The eXo refuses worship and evaporates those they try. The eXo also punishes minor deities that accept worship, though not as strictly. 

All sentient creatures have a connection to The Hendenciad and the eXo. There are Divination spells that reveal the strength of connection to the Hendenciad, but not the eXo as worship of the eXo is forbidden. Connections most direcrly affect Clerics, and others through boons. 

Boons are similar to Conan's "Crom, Count the Dead" invocation. It can sometimes offer a +1 bonus of similar effect. As the connection grows, they happen more frequently. The deity may eventually ask for a favor in return. 

There are regional forms of magic. There is Five Salts Magic, Crabstone Magic, Dragon Magic, and traditonal magic. Sorcerers are the same with different bloodlines, but warlocks are rare as the cosmology has no angels/demons/devils in it. Think minor deities. 

Psionics are the purview of the Sea God. Limited ESP, but no domination-based abilities.  Many abilities are weird as dolphins and awakened sea creatures use them to have arms and to enhance perception. Land-dwelling psionics usually have a strong connection to the Sea God. 

Land-dwelling psionics, outside of Monks, usually have a very strong connection to the Sea God. Monk's draw power from within themselves outisde of any connection with a deity.  There are psionic paladins in addition to normal paladins. 

The eXo allows paladins of the 11 other deities because creatures willing serve. That said, Paladins are not very popular except for Emiasaries (dolphins) and Canavarii. The wolf-clan is ancient and mysterious, taking action in times of crisis. Only solo players can be one. 

Firearms are crude amd limited to pistols. Magic limits the effectiveness of cannons, but they exist.  For most characters, pistols are a chance to do d8 at a distance before engaging with traditonal weapons. The Way of Hot Iron provides for mystic gunslingers. 

Lastly, Rogues are key in bridging the different magic systems. They have a chance to translate magic from one tradition to another. This ability doesn't allow them to cast spells, however. Rogues are how travelling wizards gain new spells. That's a summary of the changes.
