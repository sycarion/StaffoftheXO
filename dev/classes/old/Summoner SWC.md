## Class Abilities

**Creature Summoning:** Summoners can call any creature personally encountered and placed into their sketchbook to serve them. As they gain experience, the summoner can call more powerful creatures.

**Sketchbook:** A Summoner starts with a large book containing a total of 1d4 1 HD creatures and one 2 HD creature.

**Ability 3:** iSummoners can call any creature by reading from their sketchbook or can memorize a number of creatures to summon equal to their Level. Memorized creatures can be called without the sketchbook. A summoned creature will stay with the Summoner until it is dismissed or killed.
They have a number of spell slots they can use each day as shown in the table below. These represent a summoner's energy and the taxing nature of calling creatures over a long period. When they run out of spell slots, they cannot summon any more creatures.
Once a creature has been summoned the Summoner must test their CHA - adding the spell's level to the roll. If they fail then they reduce the number of spell slots corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. If the creature is summoned directly from the sketchbook, failure of the CHA removes the creature from the sketchbook. After roughly 8 hours rest, the number of spell slots a character has refreshes to its maximum.
