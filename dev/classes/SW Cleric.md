# Cleric
Clerics are armored warrior-priests (or -priestesses) who serve Law or Chaos. Most Clerics have a patron deity or serve a particular religion, although the unified power of Law is paramount for Lawful Clerics and has an existence in and of itself. You are a champion of your faith and moral alignment. You might be a shining knight of the faith, an exorcist of demons, or a sinister witch-hunter. Because most of a Cleric’s abilities are oriented toward healing and protecting, Clerics tend to play a support role during combat: backing up the front line, but able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the party’s Fighters if the need arises—at least for a while. As your Cleric grows in power and reputation, the character might establish a stronghold for the faith: a fortified monastery, a soaring cathedral in the wilderness, or whatever strikes the Cleric as the best way to protect and serve a growing flock of acolytes and loyal peasant followers.

## Cleric Class Abilities

**Spell Casting:** Clerics cast “divine” spells from a specific list, with numbers as per the Cleric Advancement table. Clerics of specific deities might have different lists of available spells, designed by the Referee. Each day, the Cleric selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Once a spell is cast it cannot be cast again until the next day, unless the Cleric has prepared (prayed for) the spell more than once.

**Banishing Undead:** Lawful Clerics can _turn_ undead monsters (see _Turning the Undead_ in the Combat section), making them flee from the Cleric's holiness. Whether Chaotic Clerics can affect undead at all is up to the Referee.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Clerics gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against being paralyzed or poisoned.

**Religious Stronghold (9th level):** At ninth level, a Cleric character may estblish a stronghold and attract a body of men-at-arms who will swear fealty to the character as loual (or perhaps even fanatical) soldiers and retainers.
