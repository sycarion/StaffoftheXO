Creature Summoning
Summoners can call any creature personally encountered and placed into their sketchbook to serve them. As they gain
experience, the summoner can call more powerful creatures.
Sketchbook
A Summoner starts with a large book containing a total of 1d4 1 HD creatures and one 2 HD creature.
Summoning
Summoners can call any creature by reading from their sketchbook or can memorize a number of creatures to summon equal to
their Level. Memorized creatures can be called without the sketchbook. A summoned creature will stay with the Summoner until
it is dismissed or killed.
They have a number of spell slots they can use each day as shown in the table below. These represent a summoner's energy and
the taxing nature of calling creatures over a long period. When they run out of spell slots, they cannot summon any more
creatures.
Once a creature has been summoned the Summoner must test their CHA - adding the spell's level to the roll. If they fail then they
reduce the number of spell slots corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. If the creature is summoned directly from the
sketchbook, failure of the CHA removes the creature from the sketchbook.
After roughly 8 hours rest, the number of spell slots a character has refreshes to its maximum.

1Determining Spell Slots Used
A summoner can call one or more creatures whose HD total is no greater than twice spell slot avaiable. For example, a 5th Level
spell slot can be used to call one or more creatures up to 10 HD total. Only one type of creature can be called at a time. Another
creature(s) cannot be called until the previous ones have been killed or dismissed by the summoner.
Attribute Tests for Summoned Creatures
Summoners must succeed a CHA test for a called creature to successfully hit their target. The summoner must succeed a WIS
test for a called creature to avoid damage.
If a summoned creature needs to make a save against magic or mental effects, the character must test their CHA. Physical
saves like poison, eletrocultion, or the like, are rolled against the called creature's HD+4 or 8, whichever is higher. Remember
that the Powerful Opponents rule applies to all saves and attribute tests.
Variant Summoner:Beastmaster
Here is a variation of the Summoner with a more limited list of creatures that can be summoned, but other abilities to
compensate. A Beastmaster can call flying animals as scouts, land animals to carry items, and various other animals as
sentries. In extreme danger, animals can be called for defense.

Animal Summoning
Beastmasters can call any non-magical animal personally encountered to serve them. While the animal is nearby, the
Beastmaster can telepathically communicate with the animal. This ability does not include humans. As they gain experience, the
Beastmaster can call more powerful animals. An called animal will remain with the Beastmaster until it dies or it is released.
Beastmasters rarely ask their animal companion to sacrifice its life, though the animal will unquestioningly obey such a request.
A Beastmaster starts with the knowledge to call 1d4 1 HD animals. As they gain experience, they learn to call more powerful
animals. Beastmasters do not use a sketchbook, they have detailed knowledge of any animal once it is encountered.
Unlike Summoners, a Beastmaster can call one or more creatures whose HD total is no greater the spell slot avaiable.
