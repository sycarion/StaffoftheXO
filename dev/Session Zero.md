## Session Zero

Session zero with the kids:

- Quest for an item or artifact.
- They want to find and discern clues to the location as they go along.
- Multiple groups are after this item, at least one of them with evil intent 
- No Big Bad required. 
- Visit new places.
- Learn new skills/feats/magic
- Visit weird places.
- Meet different kinds of people (e.g. the dolphins in my pinned tweet)
- If they find the item first, they want to be its guardian.

Time to get to work.
