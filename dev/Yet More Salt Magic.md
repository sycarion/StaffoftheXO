## Yet More Salt Magic

Sleepless development of [#Ommtala](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ommtala?src=hashtag_click) - Salt Magic. There are five salts, each alchemically derived from raw mined salt. Each salt maps to the five taste sensations.

Each salt is associated with its color. Raw mined salt is dubbed Brown Salt. Each salt is also associated with a loose theme of magic and/or energy type. Brown Salt is associated with earth and the force energy type. The five primary colors are red, blue, yellow, white, black.

White salt is associated with Preservation, Death, and cold energy. Yellow salt is associated with purification and Acid.

Salt mages gain mastery of an individual salt one at a time. As they gain mastery of another salt, new magics become available  There are also a few salt combinations that provide access to  magic that is unique from its contributing colors.

There is Purple from Red and Blue as well as Grey from White and Black. There is a special benefit from Yellow+White based on the re-forged in More Ancestries & Cultures. Purple is associated with Linking magic. Linking magic melds two things together like fire to a sword or invisibility to a cloak.

There is Brown Salt, the Five Salts, and five combinations. There are also two very powerful combinations of three salts, Gold and Silver. Gold is associated with clockwork while Silver is related to the mind. Silver salt deals with astral and pranic travel and Psychic energy.

Gold salt allows the creation of automatons and the harnessing of lightning. Altogether, there are 13 'schools' of Salt Magic. My favorite so far is Orange, red + yellow. It is associated with dragons. In Ommtala, each dragon is unique. No colors/metals/gems/Tiamat/Bahamut.

Dragon magic deals with draconic characteristics. Breath weapons, sure, but also flight, awe, transformation, and summoning.  In Ommtala, dragons summon minions to defend them, carry out their schemes, or gather information. They also change forms to prevent recognition.

Anyway, that the dev work this morning. Time to make the spells to go with it.
