# Project Rosencrantz
Project Rosencrantz will be a repository of markdown files for an RPG setting. This setting will be placed by a great sea and feature multiple magic traditions, non-humans that are not inspired by the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and coffee.
## What RPG will is the setting based on?
The master branch will be based on the Swords & Wizardry Complete rules, available for free at this site:
https://froggodgames.com/frogs/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/ 

### Will this be written for other systems?
The setting will be written for other systems as time allows. Preferred systems include, The Black Hack, the fifth edition of the world's most popular role-playing game, and/or Open D6.

## What makes this setting distince?
There are six different magic traditions that allows magic-users to cast spells with different power sources and different forms. The Blood Thief uses quintessence to augument or grant special abilities, Salt Mages employ five different types of salts to power spells based on color and taste of the salt, and much more.

There are non-human races, each with a unique background. The Sachima are descendants of a celestial dragon and a Tiger Lord. The Travellers appear in the city with no memories of their past. They are remarkable for their ability to breathe underwater for hours at a time and their affinity for the sea. The Emissaries are representatives of the Sea God that were born in sea. These awakened dolphins use weird mental abilities and fantastical magic to live on land. Each race is playable by a character.

Adventures can be dungeon crawls, but can also feature travelling through ancient gates to other worlds, rebuilding trade between two or more kingdoms, or saving a long-opressed people from the rule of the mad crabmen.

## When will it be available?
The goal is the fall of 2019.
