# The Staff of the eXo
The Staff of the eXo will be a repository of markdown files for an RPG setting. Fiction for the setting will written as a lexicographical novel as three dictionaries created by adherents to the three forms of deities and compiled by a librarian half a world away.

The setting takes place in a region still rebuilding after a recent war. Kingdoms in this region struggle to rebuild and hold their power. Coffee and salt are the currencies of the region. Those merchants that control the trade of coffee can hold sway over kingdoms near and far.

The treaty to end the war revived an ancient kingdom as a buffer region between the two primary combatants. This weak kingdom seeks to claim their heritage as a gateway to travel to lands near and far.

An isolated northern kingdom has opened a single port for the first time in over 100 years. The byzantine port city features roads that seem to always lead back to the docks. Attempts to establish a land route have failed.

Survivors from a large island occupied by horrific crabmen are beginning to appear on the mainland. They bring tales of strange magic and desperate enclaves seeking to overthrow their oppressors.

Due to the many fronts the war eventually opened, magic is regional and not completely reliable. There is not one grand tradition, but five smaller ones. Each magical traditional is different from the others. Salt mages employ the five salts while Hewcasters steal quintessence to warp their own bodies and gain supernatural powers. To the east, a handful of honor-bound mages use firearms invented during the war to defend their towns from ghastly creatures numerous and bizarre. Dragon magic is used by wizards in the southern kingdom while Rune Mages scrabble together the discarded magic items of their oppressors to overthrow them.

Massive temples dominate the major cities features the eleven main deities and the divine eXo. Little is known about the divine eXo, but it is believed that they serve as an overseer of the deities in punishment for the murder of their father. Every temple has a room dedicated to the slain progenitor god as well as a small statue dedicated to "an unknown god". All sentient peoples stake a claim to either a god or a titan as their creator. No sentient people claim the divine eXo: such an idea is quickly destroyed by priests.

In every town and city, small barracks-like buildings house the universally trusted Tekulim, a group of paladins that serve no deity, but appear in times of great need. They did not fight in the war, but are believed to have brought about its end. The Tekulim are noted for their stone armor and weapons made from what they call godstone. This stone can only be made by the Tekulim, but sling stones and bucklers made from it are sold publicly as a source of income.

Awakened dolphins serve as emissaries from the sea god. Their appearance is considered a good omen of peace and a plentiful harvest of fish. Wearing a suit that allows them to survive on land and protects them from harm, the emissaries swim through the air. They are as curious as they are revered.

The Dadkasun exist as shapeshifters able to assume any humanoid form. They have been exiled from civilization due to their work as spies during the war. The Dadkasun no longer appear in their true form, but make their way posing as humans, taking whatever jobs they can.

Ragozine's Column, a large island west of the mainland, is home to several refugees from the Far Horizon. They call themselves the fey. They will tell anyone that will listen about their struggle to return to their homeland. Any ships that attempt to sail west to this continent are never heard from again. Many would believe that land to be a myth were it not for their strange appearance. Human refugees pray to strange gods that do not hear them.

All this and more are featured in this setting. Stay tuned for updates.

<!--This setting will be placed by a great sea and feature multiple magic traditions, non-humans that are not inspired by the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and coffee.-->

## What RPG will is the setting based on?
The master branch will be based on the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons SRD. I am using markdown based on the files found at https://github.com/vitusventure/5thSRD

### Will this be written for other systems?
The setting will be written for other systems as time allows. Preferred systems include, The Black Hack, AlphaDuo, and/or Open D6.

## What makes this setting distinct?
There are six different magic traditions that allows magic-users to cast spells with different power sources and different forms. The Hewcaster uses quintessence to augment or grant special abilities, Salt Mages employ five different types of salts to power spells based on color and taste of the salt, and much more.

The concept of race is divided into Kith and Kin. There are non-human kith and kin, each with a unique background. The Sachima are descendants of a celestial dragon and a Tiger Lord. The Travellers appear in the city with no memories of their past. They are remarkable for their ability to breathe underwater for hours at a time and their affinity for the sea. The Emissaries are representatives of the Sea God that were born in sea. These awakened dolphins use weird mental abilities and fantastical magic to live on land. All kith and kin are available to players.

Adventures can be dungeon crawls, but can also feature traveling through ancient gates to other worlds, rebuilding trade between two or more kingdoms, or saving a long-oppressed people from the rule of the mad crabmen.

## When will it be available?
The goal is the fall of 2020.
