## Domain Options

## Trading Companies

When a character reaches name level (9th for most characters, 11th for magic-users) they may create towers or strongholds per the original rules, or they may take the path of creating a trading company. Instead of castles and lands, they manage fleets and securing trade routes and opening new routes.

## magic-user schools

A magic-user can create a tower or open a school. To aid them in teaching and gathering magic, the magic-user will also employ a number of rogues, possibly sponsoring a guild if necessary to translate different forms of magic and procure rare items.
