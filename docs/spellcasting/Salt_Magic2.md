## Salt Magic

There are five salts, each alchemically derived from raw mined salt. Each salt maps to the five taste sensations.

Each salt is associated with its color. Raw mined salt is dubbed Brown Salt.

Each salt is also associated with a loose theme of magic and/or energy type.

| Color  | Taste      | Theme                           |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Red    | bitter     | Modify (objects)                |
| Blue   | sweet      | Illusion                        |
| Yellow | sour       | Fate                            |
| White  | saline     | Protection                      |
| Black  | umami      | Destruction                     |
| Raw    | it's awful | Telekinesis / Dispel Salt Magic |

Salt mages gain mastery of an individual salt one at a time. As they gain mastery of another salt, new magics become available 

There are ten salt combinations that provide access to magic that is unique from its contributing colors.
