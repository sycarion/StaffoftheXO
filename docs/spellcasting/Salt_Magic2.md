## Salt Magic

There are five salts, each alchemically derived from raw mined salt. Each salt maps to the five taste sensations.

Each salt is associated with its color. Raw mined salt is dubbed Brown Salt.

Each salt is also associated with a loose theme of magic and/or energy type.

| Color       | Taste      | Theme                           |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Red         | bitter     | Modify (objects)                |
| Blue        | sweet      | Illusion                        |
| Yellow      | sour       | Fate                            |
| White       | saline     | Protection                      |
| Black       | umami      | Destruction                     |
| Brown (Raw) | it's awful | Telekinesis / Dispel Salt Magic |

Salt mages gain mastery of an individual salt one at a time. As they gain mastery of another salt, new magics become available 

There are ten salt combinations that provide access to magic that is unique from its contributing colors.

| Color    | Source Colors  | Theme                        |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Amber    | Yellow + Black | Mind                         |
| Crimson  | Red + Black    | Alteration (Alter Creatures) |
| Gray     | White + Black  | Light/Dark                   |
| Green    | Yellow + Blue  | Nature                       |
| Jasmine  | White + Yellow | Restoration^1^               |
| Orange   | Red + Yellow   | Conjuration                  |

^1^ *Restoration Magic is a lesser form of healing magic and is based on the Re-Forged Culture in More Ancestries & Cultures by Arcanist Press.*

^2^ *Linking magic melds two things together like fire to a sword or invisibility to a cloak.*

There are also three very powerful combinations of three salts, Gold, Silver and Rust.

| Color  | Source Colors          | Theme                        |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Gold   | Black + White + Yellow | Clockwork                    |
| Rust   | Black + White + Red    | Hew^3^                       |
| Silver | Black + White + Blue   | Astral Travel, Pranic Travel |

^3^ *Hew magic separates abilities, conditions, memories, or skills away for one or more targets. The target can be anything. There are good uses for Hew, especially in removing conditions or warts. There is an expression of 'a saltman's arm' that tells of a salt mage that would take scars, blemishes, and warts from others and put them on her arm. To this day, many salt mages wear one a garmet with a long left sleever and a short right sleeve.* 

Altogether, there are 17 *schools* of Salt Magic.

### Galen

Galen is considered the paragon of salt magic. She mastered all 17 types of salt magic though she never taught Rust Salt Magic because she feared its terrible potential. During the war, salt mages eventually discovered it with horrifying effect during the war.
