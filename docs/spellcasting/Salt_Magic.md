## Salt Magic

There are five salts, each alchemically derived from raw mined salt. Each salt maps to the five taste sensations.

Each salt is associated with its color. Raw mined salt is dubbed Brown Salt.

Each salt is also associated with a loose theme of magic and/or energy type.

| Color  | Taste      | Theme                      |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Red    | bitter     | / Fire                     |
| Blue   | sweet      | Water, Sky / Thunder       |
| Yellow | sour       | Purification / Acid        |
| White  | saline     | Preservation, Death / Cold |
| Black  | umami      | Hew^1^                     |
| Raw    | it's awful | Earth / Force Energy       |

^1^ *Hew magic separates abilities, memories, or skills away for one or more targets. The target can be anything.*

Salt mages gain mastery of an individual salt one at a time. As they gain mastery of another salt, new magics become available 

There are also a few salt combinations that provide access to magic that is unique from its contributing colors.

| Color  | Source Colors | Theme                         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Orange | Red + Yellow  | Dragon Magic^2^               |
| Purple | Red + Blue    | Link Magic^3^                 |
| Pink   | Red + White   | Enchantment / Piercing        |
| Green  | Blue + Yellow | Plants / Poison               |
| Gray   | Black + White | Metal / Bludgeoning, Slashing |

^2^ *Dragon magic deals with draconic characteristics. These include breath weapons, flight, awe, transformation, and summoning. In Ommtala, dragons summon minions to defend them, carry out their schemes, or gather information. They also change forms to prevent recognition.*

^3^ *Linking magic melds two things together like fire to a sword or invisibility to a cloak.*

Other combinations are possible, but do not generate secondary magic access.

There are also two very powerful combinations of three salts, Gold and Silver.

| Color  | Source Colors          | Theme                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Silver | Black + White + Blue   | Mind, Astral Travel, Pranic Travel / Psychic |
| Gold   | Black + White + Yellow | Clockwork / Lightning                        |

Altogether, there are 13 *schools* of Salt Magic.
