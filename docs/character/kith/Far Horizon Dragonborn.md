## Far Horizon Dragonborn Cultural Traits 

Upon arrival from the Far Horizon, dragonborn experience a great shock discovering the paucity of dragons in their new home. Seeing dragonborn that have only known the Ommtala region drives them to not only be lorekeepers for their ancestral heritage, but lorekeepers for Far Horizon knowledge in general.

Dragonborn culture is intense and exciting, leading those raised within it to be striking and remarkable individuals. Grand festivals and elaborate holidays are frequent, each centered around a different physical competition or performance, especially tales from the Far Horizon. In general, practices in Far Horizon dragonborn culture and education tend to promote athleticism, personal character, and a desire to preserve the knowledge of the old ways.

Dragonborn from anywhere are encouraged to join a Kiena (pl. Kienthis) that celebrates the history by type of Far Horizon dragon.
