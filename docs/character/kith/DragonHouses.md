I got rid of the chromatic/metallic/gemstone lore and started over just to see where it would lead.

There were ten houses of dragons and now there are eight. Individual dragons have powers through their bloodline and initiation into their house.

Each house leader is similar to a 13th age icon. Dragons maintain a loose affiliation with a house to keep their territory where they operate. The house leader may ask for a favor at any time.

Most dragons can take humanoid form at will, but their real power comes from thralls.

Thralls are humans they wish to become dragons themselves. Their fierce loyalty help dragons to expand power within their territory, but over-reliance on them will cost influence within their houses.

Those that complete the transformation will still smell a little bit human.

A dragon gains a breath weapon and a magic tradition from their bloodline. There is a breath weapon for each damage type in D&D.

A magic tradition can look like a warlock with a pact to a primordial dragon god or house leader. It can also be like a sorcerer favoring a school.

Initiation into a house provides a second breath weapon, but not immunity to it .A  house determines the humanoid form. It also provides three crafting skills as the houses are responsible for making things to benefit all dragons. These include smithing, alchemy, even thievery.
