One of the things I enjoy about Ancestries & Culture by is creative power for designing a culture outside of an ancestry.  e.g. My Tabaxi hack - culture includes proficiency with sbendonii and Tailor"s tools.

Sbendonii are like hand crossbows, but they shoot bolas. DC 10 Str check or fall prone. Tailor's tools allow for making clothes, rope, and cord. As such, they can make bolas. Add in another element to make it more fun, spiders. Why? The useof spider silk, of course.

My Tabaxi (named Emouwon based on Coptic word for cat), have artisans that can manufacture and work with spidersilk. Climbing helps with harvesting. A true artisan could make clothes that protect against slashing and piercing damage as well as unbreakable bola cords. 

An NPC of Human Ancestry living with Emouwon, has a cool non-lethal weapon, makes their own cord for climbing, likely has a spidersilk doublet amd pantaloons, and picks up proficiency with a rapier. Yes, this is an NPC the kids will encounter.

Spidersil also provides a commodity for Emouwon villages for trade/commerce. They have a place in the game world outside of making potential adventurers. In a market, a merchant is offering Emouwa Silk. Biting it is the traditional test: if it tears, it's fake.
