# Companions

Companions are a type of character that joins the player character(s). Often, they specialize in a set of skills lacking in others that comprise the party. Companions also support the cohort style of play featuring one player character adventuring with one or more companions. It is important to work out who will be controlling companions, it can be the players, the gamemaster, or shared by both.

**Disciple:** A disciple casts spells from one tradition of arcane magic or employ divine magic. They are not necessarily students of any player character in the party.

**Hireling:** A hireling is not particularly skilled at anything, but may be employed to perform mundane tasks such as feeding and brushing the horses, cleaning weapons, or holding torches. A hireling may also be a squire in service to a player character learning how to fight or a seneschal in charge managing a player character's estate.

**Mentalist:** A mentalist employs psionic power to affect the world around them.

**Mercenary:** A mercenary is skilled with one or more weapons. A mercenary may also be skilled in unarmed combat or grappling.

**Specialist:** A specialist is adept with one or more non-magical skills or tools. They also have some martial training.

### Customizing Companions

**Ancestral Traits.** You can add ancestral traits to a companion. For example, ~~a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player's Handbook.~~    
**Favored Spells.** Instead of the generic abilties listed, add a spell that a disciple may prefer to cast.  
**Armor and Weapon Swaps.** You can upgrade or downgrade a companion's armor, or switch weapons.  Remember to make adjustments to Armor Class and damage before play.    
**Magic Items.** As the characters gain experience, feel free to provide a magic item to a companion. If the gamemaster agrees, the companion could even begin with a powerful magic item. For example, the companion could be a very experienced swordsman that carries a magical blade. Bonus if it is a cursed blade. See cursed items in the equipment section. (Remember that cursed items provide a benefit and a drawback.)
