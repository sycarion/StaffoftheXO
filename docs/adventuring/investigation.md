## GATHERING CLUES

Gathering clues is simple. All you have to do is:

- Get yourself into a scene where relevant information can be gathered.
- Have the right ability to discover the clue.
- Tell the GM that you’re using that ability.

As long as you do these three things, you will never fail to gain a piece of necessary information. It is never dependent on a die roll.If you ask for it, you will get it.

You can ask for specifics: “I search the gym for footprints.” You can ask in general: “I search the gym.” You can speculate: “Is there a timestamp on the phone pic? I have Computers (or Photography).” You can fish: “I use Gossip to see if anyone knows anything about any weird hazing.” If it’s something anyone might find, like a bloodstain in the trunk, the GM gives it to the Sleuth with the highest Notice, or the Sleuth who hasn’t had a spotlight moment lately.

### Investigator's Kit

<!--This contains a variety of lenses, brushes, and tools designed to help you get the most information out of a crime scene. You may not be able to take fingerprints, but you can brush for particles, use alchemical swabs to identify unusual liquids, or make rubbings of seemingly significant inscriptions or marks. An investigator’s kit is used in conjunction with Search; it provides a +2 circumstance bonus when examining the scene and may allow you to obtain information that you couldn’t discover with the naked eye. However, using the kit increases the amount of time required for the check by a factor of five.

An investigator’s kit is designed to help you discover unusual or abnormal facts that are indicated by a crime scene. It will not help for other applications of Search, such as a rogue looking for traps.

This kit contains a number of items including three special items: Alchemical Trace, Augury Mud, a Remembrancer.

Augury Mud is made of squid ink and mud from where you found the clue. If indoors, mud from the general area will work. Augury Mud allows the investigator to ask one yes/no question. Augury Mud can be used once a day assuming the investigator takes a long rest between uses. (Optional: DM makes a secret Investigation roll for the character to determine if the answer is true.)

Remembrancers are bonded to a specific investigator and cannot be transferred if it contains a memory. The Remembrancer allows the investigator to keep a record of notes without writing them down (and leaving their own clues.) Remembrancers can be rings, knotted string tied in the investigator's hair, tattoos, or anything else. Even if suffering from the *Feeblemind* spell, the investigator can roll with disadvantage to retrieve memories stored on a remembrancer.

Alchemical Trace: The materials for an alchemical trace can tell you if a spell was cast at the scene as the investigator studies the area using alchemical agents to detect magic. Only on a critical success will it reveal the exact spell, on a success, it reveals the school of magic.
