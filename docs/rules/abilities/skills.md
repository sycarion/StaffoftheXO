## Skills

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

## Alchemy

Alchemy is the skill that ties all magic systems together. It is used  extensively by Salt Mages. In general, though, all magic systems need an understanding of alchemy to create potions or magic items based on  their spell effects. The knowledge is what allows Rogues to transcribe  spells from one magic system to another: start with trying to create a  potion of it first, and then re-translate it into any spell system in  Ommtala.

This also makes spellcasting a skill roll.

## Arcana
