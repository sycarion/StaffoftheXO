## Skills

I want to make an Attributes - Feats - Skills - Class comparison

**Feat:** A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. (PHB)

**Skill:** Skills represent some of the most basic and yet most fundamental  abilities your character possesses. As your character advances in level, he can gain new skills and improve his existing skills dramatically. (PF1e SRD)

**Skill:** While your character’s ability scores represent their raw talent and  potential, skills represent their training and experience at performing  certain tasks. (Pf2 SRD)

**Feats:** All kinds of experiences and training can shape your character beyond  what you learn by advancing in your class. Abilities that require a  degree of training but can be learned by anyone—not only members of  certain ancestries or classes—are called general feats. (Pf2 SRD)

**Class:** A collection of skills, feats, attribute boosts, and special abilities (class abilities?)

**Class:** Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. (PHB)

**Ability Scores/Attributes:** A quick description of physical and mental characteristics.

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

1. Alchemy
2. Arcana
3. Athletics
4. Craft
5. Nature
6. Perform
7. Planes Lore
8. Society
9. Speechcraft
10. Stealth
11. Thievery
12. Vehicle (Air/Land/Water)

## Alchemy

Alchemy is the skill that ties all magic systems together. It is used  extensively by Salt Mages. In general, though, all magic systems need an understanding of alchemy to create potions or magic items based on  their spell effects. The knowledge is what allows Rogues to transcribe  spells from one magic system to another: start with trying to create a  potion of it first, and then re-translate it into any spell system in  Ommtala.

This also makes spellcasting a skill roll.

## Arcana
