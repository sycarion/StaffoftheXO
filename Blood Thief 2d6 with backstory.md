# Origin of the Blood Thief

When Malken came into our city, he called for the Baron to surrender or die. As the guards drew their weapons, the men with Malken transformed into hideous devils and mishapen horrors. Too late, the city wizards tried to stop them, but Malken's power was greater than all of them. The agonized cry of the last wizard ended our courage. Hundreds lay dead, dying, or worse.

Malken was now Baron. We knelt and awaited his orders.

Most of us were farmers, but he sent us to the hills to dig for metal and salt. His hellspawn minions tore gaping holes in the earth and we marched in with picks and shovels to gleam what we could. When we collapsed, the animated corpses of the old city guards marched into the caves and continued digging throughout the night.

One day, I was with a group of three other men when one of the mine walls collapsed. Malken seemed unconcerned and we were left to die. In an attempt to dig ourselves out, we made a narrow hole that opened into small cavern. A bit of light came in from an unseen hole in the ceiling that led to the top of the hill.

As we climbed up what appeared to be a large rock formation towards the ceiling, I fell through a weak spot and woke up in a brightly lit room with smooth white walls. The walls had flickering lights and words in an unknown tongue flashed all around the room. In the center was a large stone platform. Behind it was a skeleton in white clothes. Its outfit appeared to be made from one piece of cloth with pieces of metal on the chest and arms. On its back was large block of smooth white stone with two poles coming out the top.

Most of us were farmers, but I made a living with a specialized set of skills. After some time studying the words and finding a few books in other places, I was able to make out what was flashing on the walls.

I was in some kind of ship. It was in trouble and apparently it ended up crashing into the hill. There are many tales of airships in lands to the east, but this ship was nothing like them. I learned that the stone platform was a magical device of great power. I devoted myself to making it work.

There was food in a larder that was unspoilt. I found water and wine in other rooms. As I worked to understand the magical device, I learned that the backpack the skeleton wore was key. When I picked it up, the smooth white stone broke into tiny pieces. The innards of the backpack spilled out in a heap of steel and copper.

As I said, I'm a man of skills. I know a little magic and it helped me to repair the backpack. As I put the last pieces in place, a bat made its way into the ship and crashed into everything. I set off the backpack which sent out a large spark to the bat. The bat was unharmed, but the backpack began to whur and hum. Words flashed on the armband that said "Process complete.". Sometime later, I learned how to r

# Blood Thief
The Blood Thief uses a mix of technology and magic to extract the quintessence of a creature to generate spells or potions. The extractor is an artifact of long lost technology that is barely understood. The extractor takes the quintessence of one creature and stores it. As the blood thief gains experience using the device, he or she increases to capacity to store quintessence.

As a self-taught magic practitioner, the blood thief increases his or her ability to produce spells or potions from the stored extracts of quintessence. Ultimately, the blood thief will learn to store quintessence inside gems, transcending the limits of an extractor's storage capacity.

**Link:** Using stored extracts of quintessence, a blood thief can cast a spell to link one extract to a single target, including the blood thief himself. Using self-taught skills, the link can manifest itself in one of several ways. The base chance of success is rolling 8+ with 2d6. An intelligence of 15 or higher grants a +1 to the roll.
